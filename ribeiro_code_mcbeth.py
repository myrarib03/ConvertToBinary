decimal_value = [int(str(i),2) for i in x] #to convert to decimal (base 10), you use the int function. it only works when each element is a string so make i into a string and use a for loop so each element in x is individually analyzed

#when converting from base ten to any other base, you must divide by the base number (33.7 in this case)
#for example, if you have i (represents an element in a list), then you take i and divide it by 33.7 repeatedly until the quotient is equal to zero
#once the quotient is equal to zero you take the remainders and multiply them by 33.7.
#in base 33.7, there are alpha chars and num chars, so you will need to use both.

            base_num = base_num + chr(ord('A')+(dig-10))  #Using uppercase letters. you take the unicode number of the value (use ord('A) - the start of the alphabet) and you add it to dig - 10 (subtracting by 10 because dig is over ten and you need it to be alphabetical now). Use chr() to convert the resulting value into alphabetical numbers - the corresponding str value.
